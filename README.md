## Notes for marker

- Program logic sits in `main.go`
- Included the binary `main` of the program. To run, use `./main`. The binary will run on any linux amd64 machine.
- If for some reason you would like to compile and run the program yourself, you can use the provided script to install the `go` compiler. From there run `go run main.go` to run the program.
- The program produces two `.png` files containing plots of the measurements. Refer to the report as to what these plots show.
- The `go.mod` and `go.sum` files can be ignored, they are a product of `go modules` and are only relevant if you want to compile the program yourself.
